					<h1><p>Half Empty Energy Tank is a group of passionate video gamers who have come together to provide daily video game streams on Twitch, as well
						as marathons for charity and music streams where we promote some great game-centric artists.  We also provide game content to YouTube as well.
					</p>
						<p>Events we have thrown:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Mega Man-athon 1,2 & 3</b> - A 72 hour celebration of Mega Man held at MAGFest and streamed live on Twitch.  Gamers come together to play as 
								many Mega Man games as possile.  As of MM3, we also added musical acts to the event.  Our goal is to raise as much money as we can for 
								the Childs Play charity.
							</li>
							<li><b>Extra Life</b> - Towards the end of the year, many streamers participate in a weekend of raising funds for various children hospitals.  We 
								devote 48 hours to streaming for entertainment and raising money for various charities, such as 
							</li>
							<li><b>Sonic Spring Fling</b> - This year, we held a 48+ hour marathon of our team, other gamers and musicians streaming various Sonic the Hedgehog 
							games with the goal of raising money for equipment for our charity streams. This event was featured on the front page of Twitch, which helped us meet 
							our goal!
							</li>
							<li><b>MAGFest Game Over: Raleigh</b> - This was a music event held in Downtown Raleigh featuring a number of great game-centric artists such as D&D Sluggers, 
							Eight Bit Distaster and Professor Shyguy.  We streamed the event live on Twitch and also had various game system set up so show attendees could play some games
